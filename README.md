The Coach Finder App has two features.

for the find a coach part:
- we want to be able to list all available coaches, So all the coaches that signed up with our application.
- we want to be able to view the coach details.
- We will be able to register as a coach, and we'll be able to contact a coach.
- the contact a coach feature also establishes the connection to the other part of this web app
